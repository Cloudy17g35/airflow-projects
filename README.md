# Airflow Projects Repository

  

Welcome to the Airflow Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Apache Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for various data workflows. Each DAG represents a distinct data pipeline or workflow, designed to be orchestrated using Apache Airflow. Additionally, the repository provides a Docker Compose configuration to easily set up and run the Airflow environment using Docker containers.

## Introduction

  

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. This repository aims to provide a collection of reusable DAGs that cover various data processing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks. The included Docker Compose configuration enables you to quickly set up an isolated Airflow environment for local development and testing.

  

## Getting Started

  

### Prerequisites

  

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker)

  

### Setup

  

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

  

```sh

git clone https://github.com/Cloudy17g35/airflow-projects.git

cd airflow-projects

```

  

2. Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

  

```sh

docker-compose up -d

```

  

This command will pull the necessary Docker images, set up the Airflow environment, and start the Airflow web server and scheduler.

  

3. Access the Airflow UI in your browser:

  

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the Airflow web interface.

  

## Project Structure

  

The repository is organized as follows:

  

```

airflow-projects/

│

├── dags/

│ ├── dag1.py

│ ├── dag2.py

│ └── ...

│

├── docker-compose.yaml

├── .gitignore

└── README.md

```

  

- The `dags` directory contains individual DAG definition files (Python scripts) representing different workflows.

- The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the Docker Compose configuration for setting up the Airflow environment.

- The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by version control.

- The `README.md` file (this file) provides an overview of the repository and instructions for getting started.

  

## DAG Descriptions

  

Each DAG within the `dags` directory represents a specific data workflow. Refer to the individual DAG files for detailed descriptions and tasks included in each workflow.

  

## Running the DAGs

  

1. After starting the Docker containers (using `docker-compose up -d`), you can access the Airflow UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

2. Use the Airflow UI to enable and trigger the individual DAGs as needed.

3. Monitor the progress and logs of your workflows through the Airflow UI.
